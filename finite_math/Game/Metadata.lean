/-- The binomial theorem for natural numbers, without Nat.cast coercion.

`add_pow` works over any `CommSemiring R` and inserts `↑(Nat.choose n m)`
via `Nat.cast`. When `R = ℕ` the cast is definitionally `id`, so `exact`
and `apply` see through it, but `rw` does not (it needs a syntactic match).

This wrapper states the theorem directly over `ℕ` so that `rw` and
`Finset.sum_congr` work without fighting `Nat.cast`. -/
theorem add_pow_nat (x y n : ℕ) :
    (x + y) ^ n =
      ∑ m ∈ Finset.range (n + 1), x ^ m * y ^ (n - m) * Nat.choose n m :=

These docs are needed by the GameServer when tactics/theorems are disabled.
They are placed here so all level files can reference them.
-/

/-! ### NNG4-baseline tactics

These tactics are assumed known from the Natural Number Game or
equivalent. They are introduced in Level 1 so the game doesn't warn
about missing introductions.
-/

/-- `exact e` closes the goal if `e` has exactly the type of the goal.

## Syntax
```
exact expression
```

## When to use it
When you have a term (variable, function application, constructor)
whose type matches the goal exactly.
-/
TacticDoc exact

/-- `rw [h]` rewrites the goal using an equation or iff `h`.

## Syntax
```
rw [h]           -- rewrite the goal
rw [h] at hyp    -- rewrite a hypothesis
rw [← h]         -- rewrite right-to-left
rw [h1, h2, h3]  -- chain multiple rewrites
```

## When to use it
When you have an equation `h : a = b` or iff `h : P ↔ Q` and want
to replace `a` with `b` (or `P` with `Q`) in the goal or a hypothesis.

antecedent of an implication into the context.

performs case analysis on `x`, creating one subgoal per constructor.

## Syntax

cases x with
| constructor₁ args => tactic₁

```

## When to use it
When you want to consider all possible forms of a value (e.g., natural
numbers are `zero` or `succ n`, propositions with `∨` have `inl` and `inr`).
-/
TacticDoc cases

/-- `have h := expr` introduces a new hypothesis `h` with value `expr`.

## Syntax
```
have h := expr           -- Lean infers the type
have h : type := expr    -- explicit type annotation
have h : type := by ...  -- prove the hypothesis with tactics
```

## When to use it
When you need an intermediate fact that isn't directly in your context.
-/
TacticDoc «have»

/-- `use expr` provides a witness for an existential goal `∃ x, P x`.

## Syntax

into its components.

(splits into `P → Q` and `Q → P`).

implication, or theorem whose conclusion matches the goal's type.

## Syntax

`apply e`, the remaining goals are the *premises* of `e`.

## Example
```
-- h : P → Q, Goal: Q
apply h
-- remaining goal: P
```

TacticDoc apply

/-- `norm_num` evaluates numerical expressions and closes arithmetic
goals that can be decided by computation.

Disabled in levels where manual arithmetic reasoning is the lesson.
-/

/-! ### Baseline disabled tactics

These tactics are disabled globally because they close goals that
the player should learn to handle manually.

/-- `linarith` closes goals that are linear arithmetic consequences
of hypotheses. It handles inequalities and equalities over ordered
fields and rings.

Disabled in levels where manual inequality chaining is the lesson.

basic tactics (`rfl`, `exact True.intro`, `assumption`).

evaluating them computationally.

/-- `simp` applies a set of simplification lemmas to the goal
and hypotheses.

## `simp` vs `simp only`

- **`simp`** uses a large default lemma set — convenient but unpredictable
- **`simp only [lemma₁, lemma₂, ...]`** uses only the lemmas you specify

Prefer `simp only` when you want to control exactly which rewrites happen.
`simp only` replaces tedious chains of `rw` calls with a single targeted
simplification. For finset proofs, a common pattern:
```
simp only [Finset.mem_union, Finset.mem_inter, Finset.mem_sdiff,
           Finset.mem_insert, Finset.mem_singleton]
```

Disabled in early levels to force manual rewriting and to ensure
the player understands each proof step.

holds and one where `h : ¬P` holds.

pattern is the intended approach to case analysis.
-/
TacticDoc by_cases

/-- `tauto` closes goals that are propositional tautologies. It handles
`∨`, `∧`, `→`, `¬`, `↔`, `True`, `False`, and can use `rfl` for equalities.

Disabled in levels where the learner should construct proofs manually
using `left`/`right`, `constructor`, and specific lemmas.
-/

/-- `ring` closes goals that are equalities in commutative (semi)rings
by normalizing both sides.

Disabled in levels where the learner should use specific card_* lemmas
rather than letting ring close arithmetic goals directly.
