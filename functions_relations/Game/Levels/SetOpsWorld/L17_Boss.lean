Title "Boss: Distributivity"

Introduction "
# Boss: Intersection Distributes over Union

Time to integrate everything. Prove the **distributive law** for sets:

$$s \\cap (t \\cup u) = (s \\cap t) \\cup (s \\cap u)$$

This says: being in `s` AND in `t ∪ u` is the same as being in
`s ∩ t` OR in `s ∩ u`. It is the set-theoretic version of the
propositional identity $P \\land (Q \\lor R) \\iff (P \\land Q) \\lor (P \\land R)$.

**Skills required** (all taught in this world):
- `ext` to start a set equality proof
- `constructor` to split the `↔`
- `obtain` to destructure `∩` hypotheses
- `cases ... with | inl ... | inr ...` to split `∪` hypotheses
- `left` / `right` to build `∪` goals
- `constructor` again to build `∩` goals

The proof has two directions. Each direction requires destructuring
one side and building the other. There are no new tricks — just the
moves you have practiced. Take it one step at a time.

Conclusion "
Congratulations — you have completed **Set Operations World**!

You proved the distributive law by working through every step
of the propositional logic underlying the set operations:

| Set Operation | Logic | Proving | Using |
|---|---|---|---|
| `∪` (union) | `∨` (or) | `left`/`right` | `cases h with \\| inl \\| inr` |
| `∩` (intersection) | `∧` (and) | `constructor` | `.1`/`.2` or `obtain` |
| `ᶜ` (complement) | `¬` (not) | `intro h` | apply `h` |
| `\\` (difference) | `∧ ¬` | `constructor` | `.1`/`.2` or `obtain` |

**The central pattern**: Every set-theoretic proof is a logical proof
in disguise. To prove a set identity, use `ext` to reduce to
membership, then work purely in propositional logic.

Additional tools and results from this world:
- `push_neg` — pushes negation through connectives
- `by_contra` — proof by contradiction (classical reasoning)
- `cases h with | inl ... | inr ...` — case analysis on disjunctions
- De Morgan: `(s ∪ t)ᶜ = sᶜ ∩ tᶜ` and `(s ∩ t)ᶜ = sᶜ ∪ tᶜ`
- Complement laws: `s ∩ sᶜ = ∅` and `s ∪ sᶜ = Set.univ`
- Double complement: `sᶜᶜ = s`
- Distributivity: `s ∩ (t ∪ u) = (s ∩ t) ∪ (s ∩ u)`

**Challenge**: The *dual* distributive law `s ∪ (t ∩ u) = (s ∪ t) ∩ (s ∪ u)`
also holds. Its proof uses the same techniques — try it on paper!

**Looking ahead**: The binary operations `∪` and `∩` generalize to
indexed versions `⋃` and `⋂`. The pattern is the same: binary `∨`
generalizes to `∃` over an index, and binary `∧` generalizes to `∀`.
You will see this in the next world.

Later, you will explore how these operations interact with functions.
Preimages preserve all operations — `f⁻¹(s ∪ t) = f⁻¹(s) ∪ f⁻¹(t)`
and similarly for `∩` and `ᶜ`. But images only preserve union:
`f(s ∩ t) ⊆ f(s) ∩ f(t)` is merely a subset, not an equality in
general.

**Why the asymmetry?** Preimage is defined by `x ∈ f⁻¹(t) ↔ f(x) ∈ t`,
which directly translates logical connectives: `f(x) ∈ s ∪ t` becomes
`f(x) ∈ s ∨ f(x) ∈ t`, so preimage commutes with every set operation.
Image involves an existential (`y ∈ f(s) ↔ ∃ x ∈ s, f(x) = y`), and
`∃` does not commute with `∧` or `∀` in general — which is why images
fail on intersection and complement. This asymmetry will be a central
theme of later worlds.
