Title "Case Analysis on Unions"

Introduction "
# Case Analysis: Splitting a Union Hypothesis

So far you have been **proving** union membership (choosing `left` or
`right`). Now you must **use** a union hypothesis — when you KNOW
`x ∈ s ∪ t` and must derive something from it.

Since `x ∈ s ∪ t` is a disjunction, you handle it by **case analysis**:
consider the case `x ∈ s` and the case `x ∈ t` separately. The tactic
is `cases`:

```
cases h with | inl hs | inr ht
```

This creates two subgoals:
- **Case `inl`**: `hs : x ∈ s` in context (\"inject left\" — the left
  disjunct holds)
- **Case `inr`**: `ht : x ∈ t` in context (\"inject right\" — the right
  disjunct holds)

Handle each subgoal with a `·` prefix, just like after `constructor`.

**Your task**: Prove union commutativity at the element level. Given
`h : x ∈ s ∪ t`, prove `x ∈ t ∪ s`. You will need to \"swap sides\":
in the `inl` case (knowing `x ∈ s`), use `right`; in the `inr` case
(knowing `x ∈ t`), use `left`.

    `s` is the RIGHT operand of `t ∪ s`, use `right`."

    exact hs

    Hint "You have `ht : x ∈ t` and need `x ∈ t ∪ s`. Since
    `t` is the LEFT operand of `t ∪ s`, use `left`."

    left
    exact ht

Conclusion "
You performed case analysis on a union hypothesis for the first time!

The pattern `cases h with | inl hs | inr ht` is the standard way to
handle any hypothesis that is a disjunction (or, equivalently, a union
membership). It creates two subgoals — one for each case — and you
handle them separately.

The names `inl` and `inr` stand for \"inject left\" and \"inject right\" —
the two constructors of `Or` (disjunction). They tell you which
branch of the `∨` holds:
- `| inl hs` — the LEFT disjunct holds (`x ∈ s`)
- `| inr ht` — the RIGHT disjunct holds (`x ∈ t`)

This pattern will appear again in De Morgan's law and the boss level.
It is the set-operation counterpart of the `cases` pattern you used
for natural numbers and existentials.

**Note**: You proved the element-level version `x ∈ s ∪ t → x ∈ t ∪ s`.
Combining this with `ext` would give the set equality `s ∪ t = t ∪ s`
(`Set.union_comm`). You will see this `ext` + element-level-fact pattern
in later levels.
