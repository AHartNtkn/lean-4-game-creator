Title "Boss: Indexed Union Distributes over Intersection"

Introduction "
# Boss: Distributivity for Indexed Unions

In Set Operations World, you proved the **distributive law** for binary
operations: $s \\cap (t \\cup u) = (s \\cap t) \\cup (s \\cap u)$. Now prove
the indexed generalization:

$$(\\bigcup_i s_i) \\cap t = \\bigcup_i (s_i \\cap t)$$

This says: being in some `s i` AND in `t` is the same as being in
some `s i ∩ t`.

**Skills required** (all taught in this world and earlier):
- `ext` to start a set equality proof (Subset World)
- `constructor` to split the `↔` (NNG4-baseline)
- `obtain` to destructure `∩` hypotheses (Subset World)
- `rw [Set.mem_iUnion]` to handle indexed unions (this world)
- `obtain` to destructure `∃` (Set World)
- `use` to provide witness indices (this world)

**Proof plan**: The proof has two directions. In each direction, you
will need to unpack an indexed union (getting an `∃`), destructure
an intersection (getting an `∧`), and rebuild the other side.

## Syntax
```
rw [Set.mem_range]        -- on the goal
rw [Set.mem_range] at h   -- on a hypothesis
```

## When to use it
When you see `x ∈ Set.range f` and want to work with the underlying
existential `∃ a, f a = x`, or vice versa.

Conclusion "
Congratulations — you have completed **Indexed Operations World**!

You proved that indexed unions distribute over intersection:
$(\\bigcup_i s_i) \\cap t = \\bigcup_i (s_i \\cap t)$

This is the same *extract-transform-repack* pattern from Level 5
(monotonicity of indexed union), now with an intersection layer added.
In each direction, you extracted data from the hypothesis, transformed
it (regrouping the intersection and union membership), and repacked it
into the goal.

The proof integrated every major skill from this world:

| Move | Where used |
|---|---|
| `ext x` | start the set equality |
| `constructor` | split `↔` and `∩` |
| `obtain` | destructure `∩` and `∃` |
| `rw [Set.mem_iUnion]` | convert `⋃` to `∃` |
| `use i` | provide witness index |
| `exact` | close goals |

**Recap of this world**:

| Construction | Notation | Meaning | Key lemma |
|---|---|---|---|
| Indexed union | `⋃ i, s i` | `∃ i, x ∈ s i` | `Set.mem_iUnion` |
| Indexed intersection | `⋂ i, s i` | `∀ i, x ∈ s i` | `Set.mem_iInter` |
| Bounded union | `⋃ i ∈ t, s i` | `∃ i ∈ t, x ∈ s i` | `Set.mem_iUnion₂` |
| Bounded intersection | `⋂ i ∈ t, s i` | `∀ i ∈ t, x ∈ s i` | `Set.mem_iInter₂` |
| Cartesian product | `s ×ˢ t` | `p.1 ∈ s ∧ p.2 ∈ t` | `Set.mem_prod` |
| Nonemptiness | `Set.Nonempty s` | `∃ x, x ∈ s` | — |
| Powerset | `𝒫 s` | `t ⊆ s` | `Set.mem_powerset_iff` |

Together with Level 22, you proved both distributive laws:

| Law | Statement |
|---|---|
| Level 22 | $(\\bigcap_i s_i) \\cup t = \\bigcap_i (s_i \\cup t)$ |
| This level | $(\\bigcup_i s_i) \\cap t = \\bigcup_i (s_i \\cap t)$ |

**The pattern persists**: Every set construction reduces to a logical
statement. Indexed unions and intersections are the quantifier versions
of binary union and intersection. Cartesian products are conjunctions
of pair components. Powerset membership is subset.

**A note on naming**: In Lean's Mathlib library, `⋃` and `⋂` are
special cases of a general lattice structure where `⋃ = iSup` and
`⋂ = iInf`. That is why you sometimes see `iSup` and `iInf` in
theorem names (like the disabled `iSup_inf_eq`).

**Looking ahead**: Indexed unions will be essential when studying
images and preimages of functions. For example, images distribute
over unions: $f(\\bigcup_i s_i) = \\bigcup_i f(s_i)$ — a fact whose
proof uses exactly the skills you just practiced.

But first: a problem set that will test all the set theory you have
learned so far — membership, subsets, set operations, and indexed
operations — on fresh problems with less scaffolding.
