# Course Plan: Functions & Relations

## 1. Course Promise

By the end of this course, the learner will be able to:
- Reason about sets as predicates, unfolding membership to propositional logic
- Prove set equalities by extensionality and derive subset relations
- Work with images, preimages, and their (a)symmetries under set operations
- Prove injectivity, surjectivity, and bijectivity using canonical proof shapes, both globally and on restricted sets
- Construct and verify equivalence relations, build quotient types, and lift functions through quotients
- State and use the partition–equivalence-relation correspondence
- Navigate subtypes, coercions, and the `↥s` notation connecting sets and types
- Build `Equiv` structures and reason about bundled bijections
- Prove countability via injections/encodings, prove uncountability via Cantor-style diagonalization
- Translate between formal Lean proofs and informal mathematical reasoning about functions, relations, and cardinality

## 2. Learner Profile

- **Prerequisites**: NNG4-level Lean fluency. The learner can use `rw`, `exact`, `apply`, `intro`, `cases`, `constructor`, `assumption`, `have`, `use`, and `induction`. They can read goal states and work in tactic mode.
- **What they do NOT know**: Sets as predicates (`Set α = α → Prop`); set-builder notation `{x | p x}`; image/preimage notation (`f '' s`, `f ⁻¹' t`); indexed unions/intersections; `ext` for set extensionality; `rintro`/`rcases`/`obtain` for pattern matching; `push_neg`; `Setoid`/`Quotient` machinery; subtypes (`{x // p x}`); coercions (`↥s`); `Equiv`; `Countable`/`Encodable`/`Denumerable`.
- **Mathematical background**: Comfortable with propositional logic and natural number arithmetic. Informal familiarity with sets, functions, and injective/surjective is helpful but not assumed.

## 3. Granularity Plan

### Macro (course)
The course has 8 phases, 28 worlds. Each phase builds on the previous and adds one major conceptual layer.

### Meso (world)
Each world covers one theorem family, one proof-move cluster, or one concrete object family. The world introduction states the world's center of gravity. The boss integrates the world's main moves.

### Micro (level)
Each level isolates one dominant lesson. The novelty budget is strict: at most one new burden per level (new math, new proof move, new Lean tactic, OR new notation). Everything else should be familiar enough to be automatic.

### Phase 1: Sets and Logic (Worlds 1–5)

#### W01: SetWorld (Onboarding/Lecture)

**Type**: Onboarding + Lecture hybrid

**Promise**: By the end of this world, the learner will understand that `Set α = α → Prop`, be able to unfold set membership to its predicate definition, prove simple membership statements, and work with `Set.univ` and `∅`.

**Theorem families**:
- `Set α` as `α → Prop`
- `Set.mem` / `∈` — membership
- `setOf` — `{x | p x}` notation
- `Set.univ` and `Set.empty` / `∅`
- `Set.mem_setOf_eq` (conceptual, not as a simp lemma)

**Proof-move goals**:
- Unfold `x ∈ {y | p y}` to `p x`
- Prove membership by evaluating the predicate
- Prove `x ∈ Set.univ` and `x ∉ (∅ : Set α)`

**Inventory changes**:
- `NewDefinition Set Set.mem setOf Set.univ Set.empty`
- `TheoremTab "Set"`

**Level sketch**:
- L01: Welcome to sets. What is `Set α`? Trivial membership: prove `x ∈ (Set.univ : Set ℕ)`. Lesson: sets are predicates; membership is applying a predicate.
- L02: Set builder notation. Prove `3 ∈ {n : ℕ | n < 5}`. Lesson: `{x | p x}` notation unfolds to `p x`.
- L03: Non-membership. Prove `7 ∉ {n : ℕ | n < 5}`. Lesson: `∉` is `¬ ∈`.
- L04: An infinite set. Prove `4 ∈ {n : ℕ | Even n}`. Lesson: sets need not be finite.
- L05: The empty set. Prove `∀ n : ℕ, n ∉ (∅ : Set ℕ)`. Lesson: `∅` has no elements; `intro` then unfold.
- L06: Universal set. Prove `∀ n : ℕ, n ∈ Set.univ`. Lesson: everything is in `Set.univ`.
- L07 (Boss): Given `p : ℕ → Prop` and a hypothesis about `p`, prove membership and non-membership in `{n | p n}`. Integration of unfolding + logic.

#### W02: SubsetWorld (Lecture)

**Type**: Lecture

**Theorem families**:
- `Set.subset` / `⊆` — `∀ x, x ∈ s → x ∈ t`
- `Set.ext` — `s = t ↔ ∀ x, x ∈ s ↔ x ∈ t`
- `∅ ⊆ s`, `s ⊆ Set.univ`
- Subset transitivity
- `Set.Subset.antisymm` — `s ⊆ t → t ⊆ s → s = t`

**Proof-move goals**:

- L06: Double containment without `ext`. Prove set equality from two subset hypotheses using `Set.Subset.antisymm`. Lesson: alternative route to set equality.
- L07 (Boss): Prove a set equality that requires both directions of double containment with nontrivial logic in each direction. Integration of `intro`, `ext`, `constructor`, subset chaining.

#### W03: SetOpsWorld (Lecture)

**Type**: Lecture

**Promise**: By the end of this world, the learner will understand that set operations reduce to propositional logic: `∪` ↔ `∨`, `∩` ↔ `∧`, `ᶜ` ↔ `¬`, `\` ↔ `∧ ¬`.

**Theorem families**:
- `Set.union` / `∪` — connected to `∨`
- `Set.inter` / `∩` — connected to `∧`

**Inventory changes**:
- `NewTactic push_neg` — pushing negation through quantifiers

**Dependencies**: W01, W02

**Pset partner**: PsetSets (W05)

#### W04: IndexedOpsWorld (Lecture)

**Type**: Lecture

**Promise**: By the end of this world, the learner will work with indexed unions and intersections (`⋃ i, s i` and `⋂ i, s i`), cartesian products (`s ×ˢ t`), and `Set.Nonempty`.

**Center of gravity rationale**: This world bundles indexed operations, products, nonemptiness, and powerset because they all represent "compound set constructions beyond binary ∪/∩/ᶜ/\" — constructions that take families of sets, build products, or assert existence. The learner has just mastered binary operations in W03 and this world is the natural next layer of set-construction complexity. Splitting these into separate worlds would create worlds too small to sustain a coherent introduction-practice-boss arc.

**Theorem families**:
- `Set.iUnion` / `⋃ i, s i` — membership via `∃ i, x ∈ s i`
- `Set.iInter` / `⋂ i, s i` — membership via `∀ i, x ∈ s i`
- Bounded variants: `⋃ i ∈ t, s i` and `⋂ i ∈ t, s i`
- `Set.prod` / `s ×ˢ t` — membership is `∧`
- `Set.Nonempty` — `∃ x, x ∈ s`
- `Set.powerset` / `𝒫 s` — `𝒫 s = {t | t ⊆ s}`

**Proof-move goals**:
- Prove `x ∈ ⋃ i, s i` by `rw [Set.mem_iUnion]` then `use` witness index
- Prove `x ∈ ⋂ i, s i` by `rw [Set.mem_iInter]` then `intro i`
- Prove `Set.Nonempty s` by exhibiting a witness `⟨x, hx⟩`
- Prove `(a, b) ∈ s ×ˢ t` by proving `a ∈ s ∧ b ∈ t`

**Inventory changes**:
- `NewDefinition Set.iUnion Set.iInter Set.prod Set.Nonempty Set.powerset`
- `NewTheorem Set.mem_iUnion Set.mem_iInter`

**Level sketch**:
- L01: Indexed union. Prove membership in `⋃ k : Fin 3, {n : ℕ | n % 3 = k}`. Lesson: `⋃` means `∃`; `rw [Set.mem_iUnion]` then `use`.
- L02: Indexed intersection. Prove membership in `⋂ k : Fin 3, {n : ℕ | n ≥ k}`. Lesson: `⋂` means `∀`; `rw [Set.mem_iInter]` then `intro`.
- L03: Bounded indexed union. Work with `⋃ i ∈ Finset.range 3, ...`. Lesson: bounded variant unfolds to `∃ i, ∃ _ : i ∈ t, ...`.
- L04: Cartesian product. Prove `(2, 3) ∈ ({n | Even n} ×ˢ {n | n < 5})`. Lesson: `×ˢ` membership is `∧`.
- L05: Nonemptiness. Prove `Set.Nonempty {n : ℕ | Even n}`. Lesson: exhibit a witness.
- L06: Powerset. Prove `{n : ℕ | n < 3} ∈ 𝒫 {n | n < 5}`. Lesson: `𝒫` membership is `⊆`.
- L07: Indexed union equals univ. Prove `⋃ k : Fin 3, {n : ℕ | n % 3 = k} = Set.univ`. Lesson: `ext`, then both directions using `use`/`omega`.
- L08 (Boss): Prove a statement combining indexed operations with subset reasoning. E.g., `⋂ i, s i ⊆ s j` for a specific `j`. Requires `intro`, `mem_iInter`, specialization.

**Misconceptions addressed**: `⋃` uses `∃` (not `∨`); `⋂` uses `∀` (not `∧`); `×ˢ` is not `×`.

#### W05: PsetSets (Problem Set)

**Type**: Pset

**Promise**: The learner retrieves and combines set-theory moves from W01–W04 on fresh surface forms with reduced scaffolding.

**Theorem families**: All from W01–W04, in new configurations.

**Proof-move goals**:
- Membership unfolding, subset proofs, set equality by `ext`, set operations to logic, indexed operations — all without prompting
- Transfer: state proof strategies in plain language

**Level sketch**:
- L01: Prove `{x : ℤ | x^2 = x} ⊆ {x | x = 0 ∨ x = 1}`. Fresh type (ℤ), requires membership unfolding + case analysis.
- L02: Prove `(s ∪ t) ∩ u ⊆ (s ∩ u) ∪ (t ∩ u)`. Abstract sets, no concrete type — pure logic transfer.

**Promise**: By the end of this world, the learner will understand preimages (`f ⁻¹' t`) and be comfortable with preimage membership, which reduces to simple function application.

**Theorem families**:
- `Set.preimage` / `f ⁻¹' t` — `x ∈ f ⁻¹' t ↔ f x ∈ t`
- Preimage preserves all set operations: `f ⁻¹' (s ∩ t) = f ⁻¹' s ∩ f ⁻¹' t`, etc.
- `f ⁻¹' Set.univ = Set.univ`, `f ⁻¹' ∅ = ∅`

**Proof-move goals**:
- Prove `x ∈ f ⁻¹' t` by showing `f x ∈ t` (direct computation)
- Prove preimage preserves intersection, union, complement

**Inventory changes**:

#### W07: ImageWorld (Lecture)

**Type**: Lecture

**Promise**: By the end of this world, the learner will understand images (`f '' s`), `Set.range`, and the critical asymmetry: image preserves unions but NOT intersections in general.

**Theorem families**:
- `Set.image` / `f '' s` — `y ∈ f '' s ↔ ∃ x ∈ s, f x = y`
- `Set.range` / `Set.range f` — image of `univ`
- Image preserves union: `f '' (s ∪ t) = f '' s ∪ f '' t`
- Image ONLY ⊆ for intersection: `f '' (s ∩ t) ⊆ f '' s ∩ f '' t`
- `image_subset_iff : f '' s ⊆ t ↔ s ⊆ f ⁻¹' t` (Galois connection)

**Proof-move goals**:
- Prove `y ∈ f '' s` by exhibiting `⟨x, hx, rfl⟩`
- Prove `f '' s ⊆ t` by taking `y ∈ f '' s`, destructuring, then showing `y ∈ t`
- Use the Galois connection `image_subset_iff` to switch viewpoints

- L03: `rintro` and `rcases`. Re-prove the L02 result using `rintro ⟨x, hx, rfl⟩` to destructure the image membership hypothesis in one step. Lesson: `rintro` combines `intro` and pattern matching; `rcases` does the same on existing hypotheses. These are the power tools for `∃`/`∧`/`∨` destructuring.
- L04: Image preserves union. Prove `f '' (s ∪ t) = f '' s ∪ f '' t`. Lesson: `ext`, both directions, using witnesses. Practice `rintro` for destructuring image membership.
- L05: Image only ⊆ for intersection. Prove `f '' (s ∩ t) ⊆ f '' s ∩ f '' t`. Lesson: the ⊆ direction; discuss why equality can fail.
- L06: `Set.range`. Prove `Set.range (fun n : ℕ => 2 * n) = {n | Even n}`. Lesson: `range f` = image of `univ`.
- L07: Galois connection. Use `image_subset_iff` to transform an image-subset goal into a preimage-subset goal. Lesson: switching viewpoints.
- L08: Image-preimage gap (⊆ direction). Prove `f '' (f ⁻¹' t) ⊆ t`. Lesson: this is only ⊆; equality requires surjectivity.
- L09: Preimage-image gap (⊇ direction). Prove `s ⊆ f ⁻¹' (f '' s)`. Lesson: this is only ⊇; equality requires injectivity.
- L10 (Boss): Prove that `f '' (f ⁻¹' t) = t` given that `f` is surjective onto `t` (i.e., `t ⊆ Set.range f`), and additionally prove `Set.Nonempty s → Set.Nonempty (f '' s)`. Requires combining image membership witnesses, preimage unfolding, surjectivity hypothesis, and nonemptiness transfer.

**Misconceptions addressed**: Image ≠ preimage for inclusions; image only preserves unions, not intersections.

**Theorem families**:
- `Set.MapsTo f s t` — `∀ x ∈ s, f x ∈ t`
- `Set.InjOn f s` — injectivity restricted to `s`
- `Set.SurjOn f s t` — surjectivity from `s` onto `t`
- `Set.BijOn f s t` — `MapsTo ∧ InjOn ∧ SurjOn`
- `Set.EqOn f g s` — equality on a set
- `InjOn f univ ↔ Injective f` — connection to global versions

**Proof-move goals**:
- Prove `MapsTo f s t` by `intro x hx` then show `f x ∈ t`
- Prove `InjOn f s` by `intro a ha b hb hab` then derive `a = b`
- Prove `SurjOn f s t` by `intro y hy` then produce `⟨x, hx, hfx⟩`
- Prove `BijOn f s t` by proving all three components

**Inventory changes**:
- `NewDefinition Set.MapsTo Set.InjOn Set.SurjOn Set.BijOn Set.EqOn`

**Level sketch**:
- L01: Prove `MapsTo (fun n => 2 * n) {n | n < 5} {n | n < 10}`. Lesson: `MapsTo` shape.
- L02: Prove `InjOn (fun n : ℕ => n % 3) {0, 1, 2}`. Lesson: `InjOn` shape — note this function is NOT globally injective.
- L03: Key example — `InjOn` without `Injective`. Prove `InjOn (fun n : ℕ => n^2) {n | 0 < n}` and show that `Injective (fun n : ℕ => n^2)` fails (since `(-2)^2 = 2^2` on ℤ, or on ℕ it's actually injective — use a different example). Alternative: `InjOn (fun n : ℕ => n % 5) {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}` vs not `Injective`.
- L04: Prove `SurjOn (fun n => 2 * n) {n | n < 5} {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}`. Lesson: `SurjOn` shape.
- L05: Prove `BijOn (fun n => 2 * n) {n | n < 5} {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}`. Lesson: combine `MapsTo`, `InjOn`, `SurjOn`.
- L06: Connection to global. Prove `InjOn f Set.univ ↔ Injective f`. Lesson: restricted to `univ` = global.
- L07 (Boss): Prove `BijOn` for a nontrivial function between two explicitly described sets, requiring all three components with real work in each. Integration of all on-set function property moves.

**Misconceptions addressed**: `InjOn f s` ≠ `Injective f`; `BijOn` needs `MapsTo` too, not just `InjOn ∧ SurjOn`.

#### W15: RelationWorld (Lecture)

**Type**: Lecture

**Promise**: By the end of this world, the learner will understand binary relations as `α → α → Prop` and as `Set (α × α)`, check reflexivity/symmetry/transitivity, translate between both representations, and distinguish equivalence relations from non-equivalence relations.

**Theorem families**:
- Binary relation as `α → α → Prop`
- Binary relation as `Set (α × α)` — and translation between the two representations
- `Set.diagonal` — `{(x, x) | x}` as the equality relation in `Set (α × α)` form
- `Reflexive`, `Symmetric`, `Transitive` (unbundled)
- `Equivalence` — bundled refl+symm+trans

**Proof-move goals**:
- Check reflexivity: `intro x`, prove `R x x`
- Check symmetry: `intro x y hxy`, prove `R y x`
- Check transitivity: `intro x y z hxy hyz`, prove `R x z`
- Translate between `R : α → α → Prop` and `{p : α × α | R p.1 p.2} : Set (α × α)`
- Connect reflexivity to `Set.diagonal ⊆ {p | R p.1 p.2}`
- Bundle into `Equivalence` structure

**Inventory changes**:

- `TheoremTab "Relation"`

**Level sketch**:

- L04: Not symmetric. Prove `¬ Symmetric (· ≤ · : ℕ → ℕ → Prop)`. Lesson: counterexample — `0 ≤ 1` but `¬ 1 ≤ 0`.
- L05: Not transitive. Prove a relation is not transitive. Lesson: counterexample.
- L06: Not reflexive. Prove `¬ Reflexive (· ≠ · : ℕ → ℕ → Prop)`. Lesson: counterexample — `0 ≠ 0` is false. Completes the three-property counterexample framework.
- L07: Relations as `Set (α × α)`. Given the mod-3 relation, restate it as `{p : ℕ × ℕ | p.1 % 3 = p.2 % 3}` and prove membership for a concrete pair. Introduce `Set.diagonal` as the equality relation: `Set.diagonal = {p | p.1 = p.2}`. Lesson: a relation is also a set of pairs.
- L08: Translation between representations. Prove that reflexivity of `R : α → α → Prop` is equivalent to `Set.diagonal ⊆ {p | R p.1 p.2}`. Lesson: the predicate and set-of-pairs views are interchangeable; `Set.diagonal` captures equality.
- L09: Bundle into `Equivalence`. Construct `Equivalence` for mod-3 from the three properties. Lesson: the `Equivalence.mk` constructor.
- L10: Same-parity equivalence. Prove `Equivalence (fun a b : ℕ => a % 2 = b % 2)`. Lesson: simplest nontrivial equivalence (2 classes). Practice the full 3-property workflow.
- L11 (Boss): Given a function `f : α → β`, prove that `fun a b => f a = f b` is an equivalence relation. This is the kernel equivalence — foreshadows `Setoid.ker`. Requires all three properties on an abstract function.

**Misconceptions addressed**: `≤` is not an equivalence relation; `≠` is not reflexive (and not transitive); relations can be viewed as predicates or as sets of pairs.

#### W16: SetoidWorld (Lecture)

**Type**: Lecture

**Promise**: By the end of this world, the learner will understand `Setoid α` as a bundled equivalence relation, construct `Quotient` types, and use `Quotient.mk'`, `Quotient.sound`, and `Quotient.exact`.

**Theorem families**:
- `Setoid α` — bundled equivalence relation as typeclass
- `Setoid.ker f` — kernel: `x ≈ y ↔ f x = f y`
- `Quotient` / `Quotient.mk'` — quotient type and projection
- `Quotient.sound` — `a ≈ b → ⟦a⟧ = ⟦b⟧`
- `Quotient.exact` — `⟦a⟧ = ⟦b⟧ → a ≈ b`

**Proof-move goals**:
- Construct a `Setoid` from an `Equivalence`
- Use `Quotient.mk'` to project into the quotient
- Prove `⟦a⟧ = ⟦b⟧` from `a ≈ b` using `Quotient.sound`
- Derive `a ≈ b` from `⟦a⟧ = ⟦b⟧` using `Quotient.exact`
- Use `≈` notation

**Inventory changes**:

**Level sketch**:
- L01: Construct a `Setoid` on ℤ from the mod-3 equivalence relation. Lesson: `Setoid.mk` with an equivalence proof.
- L02: `Setoid.ker`. Given `f : ℤ → Fin 3` (the mod-3 projection), show that `Setoid.ker f` captures mod-3 equivalence. Lesson: kernel of a function is an equivalence relation.
- L03: `Quotient.mk'`. Form `⟦a⟧` for `a : ℤ` under the mod-3 setoid. Prove that `⟦0⟧ = ⟦3⟧`. Lesson: `Quotient.sound` from `0 ≈ 3`.

#### W17: QuotientLiftWorld (Lecture)

**Type**: Lecture

**Promise**: By the end of this world, the learner will be able to lift functions through quotients using `Quotient.lift`, prove well-definedness obligations, and use `Quotient.inductionOn` for induction on quotient types.

**Proof-move goals**:
- Define a function on a quotient via `Quotient.lift f h`
- Prove the well-definedness obligation `h : ∀ a b, a ≈ b → f a = f b`
- Use `Quotient.inductionOn` to prove properties of quotient elements

**Inventory changes**:
- `NewTheorem Quotient.lift Quotient.inductionOn Quotient.map`

**Level sketch**:
- L01: Simple lift. Lift a function `f : ℤ → ℕ` (e.g., `fun n => (n % 3).toNat`) through `Quotient (Setoid.ker f)`. The well-definedness is trivial (it follows from `ker` definition). Lesson: `Quotient.lift` mechanics.
- L02: Nontrivial well-definedness. Lift `fun n : ℤ => n^2 % 3` through the mod-3 quotient. Prove well-definedness: `a ≈ b → a^2 % 3 = b^2 % 3`. Lesson: the well-definedness proof is the real work.
- L03: Well-definedness failure. Show that `fun n : ℤ => n` does NOT respect the mod-3 equivalence (i.e., cannot be lifted). Lesson: not every function lifts.
- L04: `Quotient.inductionOn`. Prove a universal property about quotient elements by reducing to representatives. Lesson: induction on quotients.
- L05: `Quotient.map`. Given two setoids and a function that respects both, construct a map between quotients. Lesson: maps between quotient types.
- L06 (Boss): Given a surjective function `f : α → β`, lift a function `g : α → γ` through `Quotient (Setoid.ker f)`, prove well-definedness, and use `Quotient.inductionOn` to show a property of the lifted function. Integration of lift + well-definedness + induction.

**Misconceptions addressed**: Quotient lifting REQUIRES well-definedness proof; not every function can be lifted.

- L04: Prove that if `f : α → β` is injective, then `Setoid.ker f` is the trivial equivalence (equality). Transfer from injectivity to quotient theory.
- L05 (Boss): Given a new equivalence relation on ℤ × ℤ (e.g., `(a,b) ≈ (c,d) ↔ a + d = b + c` — constructing ℤ from ℕ × ℕ), construct the setoid, form the quotient, and lift addition through it with a well-definedness proof. Major integration exercise.

#### W19: PartitionWorld (Lecture)

**Type**: Lecture

**Promise**: By the end of this world, the learner will understand partitions, prove the partition↔equivalence-relation correspondence, and work with equivalence classes.

**Theorem families**:
- `Setoid.classes` — the set of equivalence classes
- `Setoid.IsPartition` — partition conditions (no empty parts, covers the type, parts disjoint)
- Partition → equivalence relation
- Equivalence relation → partition
- The fundamental bijection

**Proof-move goals**:
- Prove a partition gives an equivalence relation
- Prove an equivalence relation gives a partition
- Work with equivalence classes as sets

**Inventory changes**:
- `NewDefinition Setoid.classes Setoid.IsPartition`

**Level sketch**:
- L01: Equivalence classes. For the mod-3 setoid, describe/prove a fact about the class of 0. Lesson: what an equivalence class looks like concretely.
- L02: Partition of ℤ into even/odd. Verify this is a partition. Lesson: the partition conditions.
- L03: Not a partition — overlapping parts. Show that `{{1,2}, {2,3}, {4}}` violates disjointness. Lesson: partition requires pairwise disjointness.
- L04: Not a partition — empty part. Show that including `∅` violates the no-empty-parts condition. Lesson: `IsPartition` excludes `∅`.
- L05: Partition → equivalence relation. Given a partition, define "same part" and show it's an equivalence relation. Lesson: the forward direction of the correspondence.
- L06: Equivalence relation → partition. Given an equivalence relation, show the equivalence classes form a partition. Lesson: the reverse direction.
- L07 (Boss): For the mod-3 equivalence on ℤ, prove that its equivalence classes form a partition AND that the partition recovers the original equivalence relation. Full round-trip of the correspondence.

**Misconceptions addressed**: Partitions have no empty parts; overlapping parts don't partition.

#### W20: ThreeSamenessWorld (Example/Review)

**Type**: Example + Review

**Promise**: By the end of this world, the learner will explicitly distinguish the three notions of sameness: `=` (definitional equality), `≈` (equivalence under a relation), and `≃` (bijection with data).

**Theorem families**:
- Contrast `=`, `≈`, `≃` on concrete examples
- `Quotient.sound` / `Quotient.exact` revisited
- Foreshadowing: `Equiv` (to be built in Phase 6)

**Level sketch**:
- L01: `=` on ℕ. Two natural numbers are equal iff they are the same number. Trivial but sets the baseline.
- L02: `≈` on ℤ mod 3. `0 ≈ 3` but `0 ≠ 3`. Lesson: equivalence is coarser than equality.
- L03: From `≈` to `=` in the quotient. `0 ≈ 3` means `⟦0⟧ = ⟦3⟧` in the quotient. Lesson: the quotient makes `≈` into `=`.
- L04: Foreshadow `≃`. `Fin 2` and `Bool` are "the same" in what sense? Not `=` (different types). Not `≈` (no setoid between types). They are `≃` — there's a bijection with data. Conceptual level.
- L05 (Boss): Given a concrete situation, the learner must choose and use the correct notion of sameness for each sub-goal. Integration of all three notions.

**Dependencies**: W15, W16

#### W21: SubtypeWorld (Lecture)

**Type**: Lecture

**Promise**: By the end of this world, the learner will construct subtype elements, use coercions, navigate `↥s`, and distinguish `{x | p x}` (set) from `{x // p x}` (subtype/type).

**Theorem families**:
- `Subtype` — `{x : α // p x}`
- `Subtype.val` / `Subtype.coe` / coercion `(a : α)`
- `Subtype.mk` — constructing subtype elements

- Prove equality via `Subtype.ext`
- Navigate `↥s` coercion

**Inventory changes**:

- L02: Access the value. Given `a : {n : ℕ // n > 0}`, prove a fact about `a.val`. Lesson: `Subtype.val` extracts the underlying element.
- L03: Coercion. Given `a : {n : ℕ // n > 0}`, prove a fact about `(a : ℕ)`. Lesson: coercion is `Subtype.val`.
- L04: Subtype equality. Prove that two subtype elements are equal by showing their values are equal. Lesson: `Subtype.ext`.
- L05: `↥s` coercion. Given `s : Set ℕ` and `a : ↥s`, prove a fact. Lesson: `↥s` turns a set into a type; elements have `.val` and `.property`.
- L06: Contrast `{x | p x}` and `{x // p x}`. Side-by-side: one is a `Set`, the other is a `Type`. Lesson: the fundamental notation distinction.
- L07: Restrict a function. Given `f : ℕ → ℕ` and `s : Set ℕ`, define `f` restricted to `↥s` → ℕ. Lesson: function restriction via subtypes.
- L08 (Boss): Given `s : Set ℕ` and a function `f : ↥s → ℕ`, construct a subtype element, apply `f`, and prove something about the result using both coercion and `Subtype.ext`. Integration.

**Misconceptions addressed**: `{x | p x}` is a `Set`, `{x // p x}` is a `Type`; `↥s` silently changes the type context.

- L06: `Equiv.ofInjective`. Given `Injective f`, produce an equiv from the domain to the range. Lesson: domain ≃ range.
- L07 (Boss): Construct a nontrivial `Equiv` (e.g., between `{n : ℕ // n > 0}` and `ℕ` via `n ↦ n - 1` / `m ↦ m + 1`), prove both inverse conditions, then compose it with another equiv. Integration of construction + composition.

**Misconceptions addressed**: `Equiv` is data (forward + inverse + proofs), not just "bijectivity."

Integration of construction + Denumerable retrieval + closure.

**Misconceptions addressed**: `Countable` is nonconstructive; `Encodable` is constructive; `Denumerable` requires surjectivity of decode.

#### W26: CantorWorld (Lecture)

**Type**: Lecture

**Promise**: By the end of this world, the learner will understand Cantor's theorem (no surjection `α → Set α`), prove it via the diagonal argument, and derive uncountability results.

- L05: Uncountability of `Set ℕ`. Use Cantor to prove `¬ Countable (Set ℕ)`. Lesson: connecting Cantor to countability.

**Misconceptions addressed**: Cantor ≠ uncountability of ℝ (related but distinct); the diagonal argument works for any type, not just ℕ.

- L04: Encodable transfer. Construct an `Encodable` instance for a fresh type (e.g., `Option ℕ` or a sum type) by supplying explicit `encode`/`decode` functions. Transfer of the constructive countability interface to a new setting.
- L05: Prove `¬ Countable (ℕ → ℕ)`. Transfer: Cantor argument on a different type.
- L06: Prove `Set.Countable s → Set.Countable (f '' s)`. Retrieval of image + countability.
- L07 (Boss): Given a specific function `f : ℕ → Set ℕ`, exhibit a set not in its range by diagonal construction. Then prove `¬ Surjective f`. Transfer of Cantor to a concrete instance.

### Phase 8: Capstone (World 28)

---

#### W28: Finale (Review/Boss)

**Type**: Review + Capstone

**Promise**: By the end of this world, the learner will integrate all major course themes: sets, functions, relations, quotients, subtypes, equivs, and countability.

**Level sketch**:
- L01: First isomorphism theorem, concrete. For `f : ℤ → ZMod 3`, construct `Setoid.ker f`, form the quotient, and use `quotientKerEquivRange` to get the equiv. Integration of functions + quotients + equivs.
- L02: From surjection to equiv. Given surjective `f : α → β`, use `quotientKerEquivOfSurjective` to get `Quotient (ker f) ≃ β`. Integration.
- L03: Image and injectivity on sets. Prove `InjOn f s → f '' (s ∩ t) = f '' s ∩ f '' t`. Requires on-set injectivity + image reasoning.
- L04: Cantor meets sets. Prove `¬ ∃ f : Set ℕ → ℕ, Injective f`. Connects Cantor to function properties.
- L05: Subtype equiv via bijection on sets. Given `BijOn f s t`, construct `↥s ≃ ↥t`. The grand bridge: sets, on-set functions, subtypes, equivs — all in one proof.
- L06 (Final Boss): Prove that `Quotient.classes` of a setoid forms a partition (covering + disjoint + no empty parts), and conversely exhibit the setoid from a given partition. The round-trip of the fundamental theorem. Integration of all major themes.

**Dependencies**: All previous worlds

|------|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------------|-----------------------|

## 9. Misconception Plan

| Misconception | Where addressed | How |
|--------------|-----------------|-----|
| Sets are types | W01 introduction + W21 L06 | Explicit contrast: `{x \| p x}` vs `{x // p x}` |
| `↥s` changes type context silently | W21 L05 | Dedicated level exploring coercion |
| Image = preimage for inclusions | W07 L07–L08 | Prove both ⊆ directions; show equality requires inj/surj |
| `f '' (s ∩ t) = f '' s ∩ f '' t` | W07 L04 | Prove only ⊆; discuss failure of equality |
| `Equiv` = `Bijective` | W22 introduction + L05 | `Equiv` has data; `Bijective` is a proposition. `ofBijective` is noncomputable. |
| Quotient lift without well-definedness | W17 L03 | Explicit failure example: function that can't be lifted |
| `Countable` = `Encodable` | W25 L03–L04 | Side-by-side comparison |
| Cantor = uncountability of ℝ | W26 introduction | Explicit note: Cantor is about any `α → Set α`, not just ℝ |
| `≈` = `=` | W16, W20 | Dedicated world (W20) contrasting three notions |
| Partitions can have empty parts | W19 L04 | Counterexample: `∅` in a partition candidate |

| `BijOn` = `InjOn ∧ SurjOn` (missing MapsTo) | W13 L05 | Must prove all three components |
| `sᶜ` = `s \ t` for some `t` | W03 L03–L04 | Complement is `univ \ s`; difference is more general |

## 10. Major Risks

1. **Quotient section length**: Phase 5 has 6 worlds (W15–W20). This is the densest part of the course. Risk: learner fatigue. Mitigation: W20 (Three Sameness) is a short review/example world that breaks up the density. W18 (PsetRelations) provides retrieval practice before continuing to partitions.

2. **On-set function properties (W13–W14) may feel repetitive**: The proof shapes mirror global versions. Risk: boredom. Mitigation: focus on the *differences* (InjOn without Injective), keep the world tight, and use the pset for fresh problems rather than more of the same shape.

3. **Image/preimage asymmetry is subtle**: Learners will expect `f '' (s ∩ t) = f '' s ∩ f '' t`. Risk: confusion when only ⊆ holds. Mitigation: explicit worked example in W07 showing failure of equality, plus W08 retrieval, plus W28 showing how injectivity restores equality.

4. **Subtype/set notation confusion**: `{x | p x}` vs `{x // p x}` look similar. Risk: persistent confusion. Mitigation: explicit contrast level in W21, revisited in W24.

5. **Countability section may feel disconnected**: Phases 1–6 are about sets and functions; Phase 7 shifts to cardinality. Risk: the course feels like two courses stitched together. Mitigation: W25 and W26 heavily use injectivity/surjectivity (taught in Phase 3) and subtypes (Phase 6), making them genuine applications rather than standalone topics. W28 (Finale) ties everything back together.

6. **`Encodable`/`Denumerable` depth**: The coverage map marks these as core. Risk: too much time on constructive interfaces that the typical learner won't use. Mitigation: W25 introduces all three in sequence but keeps `Encodable`/`Denumerable` to 2 levels each. The boss focuses on `Countable` (the mathematical concept). If authoring reveals that `Encodable` internals don't provide good interactive levels, demote to supporting.

7. **Lattice alias exploit vector**: Set identities have lattice-level aliases that `exact` can find directly. Risk: learners bypass intended proofs. Mitigation: comprehensive `DisabledTheorem` list in the coverage map §6 must be applied at every relevant level. This is an operational burden on the world author.
